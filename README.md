### Solved Bugs

- One bug I encountered was making sure that all my images were aligned in each mobile device, I had wrote some CSS that contradicted what I was trying to achieve by not using the correct selectors and also closing sections in the incorrect places, after noticing this and correcting it did I achieve the layout I wanted.

- CSS: no errors were found when passing through Jigsaw validator

- ACCESSIBILITY: All the colors and fonts that were choosen are easy to ready and accessible by running it through lighthouse in devtools, as shown in the images below
