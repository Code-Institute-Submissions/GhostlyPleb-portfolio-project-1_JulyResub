- The about section at the bottom of the page simply has the links to all major social media platforms, click on each icon will direct the user to the corresponding website.


## Features Left to Implement

- On the subscribe page, I never got the chance to implement the a 404 error page once the user completes the form.
- Would like to redesign the layout of the main page, I have learned alot from just doing this assingment and if not for the time restraint then I would have choosen to do things differently.

## Testing 

- I tested the webpage in multiple differnet website e.g chrome, firefox and edge. They all worked.
- All the content is easy to ready, which will be indicated in my light house score.
- The form is working correctly aswell apart from it not bringing the user to the 404 error page once they try to submit.
- Both the Lifehacks and Subscribe links bring the user to the corresponding page.

## Bugs

### Solved Bugs

- One bug I encountered was making sure that all my images were aligned in each mobile device, I had wrote some CSS that contradicted what I was trying to achieve by not using the correct selectors and also closing sections in the incorrect places, after noticing this and correcting it did I achieve the layout I wanted.


## Validator Testing 

- HTML: no errors were returned when passing through WS3 validator

- CSS: no errors were found when passing through Jigsaw validator

- ACCESSIBILITY: All the colors and fonts that were choosen are easy to ready and accessible by running it through lighthouse in devtools, as shown in the images below

- Images of all the tests
